# wLoseControl for 3.3.5
Simple Pve + PvP @player-only remake of LoseControl WoW addon

While effective and beatiful for solo play, it does not replace DBM, Gladius, etc

Differences:
- only player frame
- built in timer(can be disabled)
- PvE & PvP profiles
- new and better priority
- buffs can be added too
- little impovements
- don t remember everything

Details:
- simple control through chat commands(chat frame 1): 
	/wlc
- buff and debuff control right in lua file(sry guys):
  add lines with spellIds found in a wowDB you like
  or
  in chat(with debug enabled and spell not added already)
